## Mohamed Bilel Besbes

I am a thesis-based Software Engineering masters student at Concordia University and I'm a research assistant at the REALISE Lab. But right before coming to Montr√©al to do research, I was in the industry for about one year and a half working as a DevOps engineer. Now, I'm back to academia working on how to improve the performance of every day usage applications.

## Research interest
Going back to academia, I wanted to work in an environment that aims to bring research and the industry together. Therefore, I'm working with my supervisor, Professor [Diego Elias Costa](https://diegoeliascosta.github.io/), to help performance engineering teams across the industry with alleviating challenges they're encoutering in an attempt to provide performant applications for the end user, especially that these solutions are becoming more complex by the day, making it necessary yet challenging to keep record of performance changes and fix them accordingly.
